## Udacity Android Nanodegree Project 5: Make Your App Material
My task for this project was to upgrade the material design of the application. I needed to transform the user experience of a news reading app using Material Design Principals. This included consistent and meaningful use of Material Design UI components, fonts, color, motion, and surfaces.

### Features:
This app can:
* Display a grid of news articles
* Display a specific news article
* Initiate a converstation with one of the user's contact
